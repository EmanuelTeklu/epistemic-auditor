# Error Log

## Task 5: GitHub Pages Deployment

**Error:** `gh` CLI not found — cannot programmatically enable GitHub Pages.

**Impact:** GitHub Pages must be enabled manually via repository settings.

**Workaround:** Instructions written to DECISIONS-NEEDED.md and DEPLOY-STATUS.md. All code is pushed and ready — only the Pages toggle needs to be flipped.

No other errors encountered during the overnight build session.
